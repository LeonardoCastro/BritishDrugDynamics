### NHS hospital admissions:

Data on Drug Misuse was compiled for three different cases of hospital admissions. The timeframe spans from the fiscal year 2008/2009 to the fiscal year 2018/2019. There are numbers for each Merged Location described in the [`Locations.md`](https://github.com/LeonardoCastro/BritishDrugDynamics/blob/master/tables/Locations.md) file.

1. NHS hospital finished admissions where there was a **primary diagnosis of drug related mental health and behavioural disorders**, by region and merged location.

2. NHS hospital finished admission episodes with a **primary or secondary diagnosis of drug related mental and behavioural disorders**, by region and merged location.

3. NHS hospital finished admissions where a **primary diagnosis of poisoning by drugs**, by region and merged location.

In addition to the total number of admissions by region and merged locations from 2008 to 2019, we also have the total number of admissions by primary diagnosis and by age group. We present the data available in the following table, showing the timeframe and the geographical resolution (merged locations, regions, national)

|   | Primary diagnosis  | Age group          |
|---|--------------------|--------------------|
|1. | 2008-2019, national| 2008-2019, national|
|2. | -                  | 2008-2019, national|
|3. | 2012-2019, national| 2008-2019, national|
