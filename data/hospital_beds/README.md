# Hospital beds

We include the time series of the day-only hospital beds in England, from 2009 to 2019. The time series are given in three different resolutions: merged local authorities, police local forces and regional level. Merged local authorities can be consulted [here](https://github.com/LeonardoCastro/BritishDrugDynamics/blob/master/tables/locations.md), and police local forces [here](https://github.com/LeonardoCastro/BritishDrugDynamics/blob/master/tables/Police_forces.md). The 9 regions of England are:
- East of England
- East Midlands
- London
- North East
- North West
- South East
- South West
- West Midlands
- Yorkshire and the Humber

Hospital beds are given in total numbers and by 100k inhabitants.
