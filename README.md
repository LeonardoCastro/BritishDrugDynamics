The aim of this project is to explore the illicit drug market in the UK using different sources of open data. The project is still in an early phase and it will be updated as frequent as possible, depending on the advances obtained.

**Update:** There will be a poster of the project displayed in the [AI-UK conference](https://www.turing.ac.uk/ai-uk) organised by the Alan Turing Institute (March 24 and 25, 2020).
