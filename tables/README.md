# Tables

This directory consists of different tables presenting the different divisions of territory of England and how they were homogenised.

- [`Locations.md`](https://github.com/LeonardoCastro/BritishDrugDynamics/blob/master/tables/Locations.md) presents the different NHS authorities. From the PCTs before 2012, the Local Authorities in which these PCTs were merged, and the chosen counties used.
- [`Police_forces.md`](https://github.com/LeonardoCastro/BritishDrugDynamics/blob/master/tables/Police_forces.md) presents the different local police forces in England and their composition with respect to the chosen counties used.  

## Geographical locations

Up until the [Health and Social Care Act 2012](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_and_Social_Care_Act_2012), the administrative bodies of the NHS was divided in _Strategic Health Areas_ ([SHAs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strategic_health_authority)). Within these areas, we could find the _Primary Care Trusts_ ([PCTs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NHS_primary_care_trust)), which was a second division of the SHAs to cover the whole territory. Before their abolition, there were 10 SHAs and 152 PCTs covering England. With the Health and Social Care Act 2012, the administrative responsibilities were then passed to the [Local Authorities](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Local_government_in_Englan) in England, resulting in 151 bodies.

In order to have a homogenised database that comprises pre-2012 and post-2012 data, we compiled [a list of both PCTs and Local Authorities](https://github.com/LeonardoCastro/BritishDrugDynamics/blob/master/Locations.md), allowing us to obtain a homogenised list of 134 England zones.

## Police force areas

Every local police force has a designated area including different local authorities. These areas are in a higher tier than local authorities are, but in a lower tier than regions in England. Thus, it is important to clearly state which merged authorities shown in [`Locations.md`](https://github.com/LeonardoCastro/BritishDrugDynamics/blob/master/tables/Locations.md) are present in each police force area. A good compilation of Local Forces in England is found [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_police_forces_of_the_United_Kingdom).
